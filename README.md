# Healthcare Cost Analysis and Prediction Project

A data science project that explores drivers of healthcare costs and builds a model to predict medical charges using patient attributes.

## Technologies
- Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🔍 Key Findings from EDA

- Smokers have significantly higher medical costs compared to non-smokers.
- Age has a moderate positive correlation with charges.
- High BMI increases charges mostly among smokers.
- Children and region don’t seem to have much impact.
- Medical charges are heavily skewed, with a few very high-cost outliers.

## ✅ Project Progress

- [x] Dataset loaded and cleaned
- [x] Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- [ ] Feature engineering
- [ ] Model building (linear regression, tree-based models)
- [ ] Model evaluation
- [ ] Streamlit app (optional)

## 📓 Notebooks

- [`01_eda.ipynb`](./notebooks/01_eda.ipynb) – Exploratory data analysis
